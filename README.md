# Classifying text data

## Part 1: Introducing Myself 
Dear Hiring Manager, 

I am a fourth year Computer Science student who has taken classes on and implemented project using machine learning principles. I am looking for a new opportunity to apply my skills in this field and build my experience with applying what I have learned. 
I am familiar with utilizing both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to solve classification and prediction problems. I have implemented the following models in python:
* Supervised Machine learning
  - Linear Regression 
  - k Nearest Neighbors clustering
  - Decision Trees
  - Random forests
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Gradient Descent (batch, stochastic, and mini-batch)
  - Neural Networks
* Unsupervised Machine learning
  - k Means clustering
  - Singular value decomposition
  - Principle Component Analysis
  
In this portfolio, I provide examples of k Nearest Neighbors clustering, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and k Means clustering. In the project 3 files in particular my goal was to use supervised and unsupervised machine learning together to solve compatible tasks, first using unsupervised machine learning in the form of kNN to analyze trends in data without my intervention and then k-means to cluster the data with more user interaction and direction. 
  
  I have also learned several evaluation metrics that allow me to optimize my parameters, for example using the elbow method to find the best k-value for kNN clustering and comparing SVD performance using MSE. I have also used cross validation to select an optimal model for a machine learning task. The ability to choose my own parameters and critically evaluate models showws I have some depth of knowledge on the math and logic behind machine learning algorithms beyond just implementing them, which will prepare me to come up with novel solutions to any problems requiring machine learning problems in this position. Better understanding the way these algorithms work will also help me apply them in context and think of the ethical implications and potential bias sources that they are likely to encounter- for example the importance of being skepical about weight assignments in linear regressions that should be drawing from many variables to create a holistic model. I also have experience implementing and analysing Gini scores, minimizing error bars for SVD, using Euclidean distance metrics, and evaluating different notions of the time it takes a program to run (seconds, iterations, and epochs). 
  
In the project 2 files of this folder a major part of my goal was to evaluate my Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine models to optimize my parameters by comparing accuracy scores, and then to compare my models using cross validation. 

  
  Beyond machine learning, I have an extensive biology background. A lot of my work is actually still related machine learning, but adding the biology lense to it really interested me. I do a lot of work with microbial genomes, analyzing differences in sequences and attempting to create models of ecological niches and evolutionary history.
