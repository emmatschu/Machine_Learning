"hello, my previous post was taken down. However I am still dealing with the situation that occured in Jordan, and I need to find my way out of this house. To help people understand the urgency of this post, here is the situation: On Monday, I asked the jordan GroupMe to do better cleaning up after using the sinks, for every sink had food waste, toothpaste, and garbage in it when I went to brush my teeth. I said that if anyone felt some type of way about it then I was talking to them. the HP sent me a private text message trying to patronize my concerns, stating that Jordan is one of the¬†cleanest houses on campus and our housekeeper is satisfied with its current state,¬† and when I tried to end the conversation, she went on to say that people are uncomfortable talking to me because I am negative, scary, and threatening which is racially charged language.

"predator alert: ~26/27 yr old guy who walks 2 dogs throughout campus and on west street (st that the parking garage is on). He has gone by multiple names, when I knew him years ago he went by Brian Romero, but he also uses the name wolf. He has sexually assaulted two of my friends and has used drugs to disable individuals to assault them. I am posting this on the confessional because he has tried to create bonds with Smith students and uses his dogs as a means to get women and femme people to interact with him. Because none of the assaults have happened to smith college students the college cannot ban him from the property even though he is a predator. I have seen him in the smith college gym and inside some buildings. Please be cautious. ",74,4,4,

"genuine advice for firsties as a senior; -dont go telling ppl ur GPA or cry about getting a b; we do not care so keep it to yourself.- dont expect ppl to reach out to you; be extroverted and ask ppl to hang to make friends. otherwise dont complain about being lonely.-the food here sucks be prepared for constant repeats- CC Cafe is expensive asf- ur first job is most likely going to be dish duty in dining halls thats okay.- dont be an asshole and run around the hallways at night. no one will like you. even in the quad.-the parties here are lame dont go to them. not worth ur time.- expect a lot of fake woke ppl- Alumni Gym is so quiet and discrete. nice place to study. -get ur laundry out as soon as its done or ppl will move it and throw it on the floor, dirty counter, or if youre lucky in a dryer (thats missing all ur underwear)-not everyone here is a lesbian so dont come here expecting to find a ‚Äúhot butch 10000 piercings and tatted wife‚Äù from the go.-you will see men on ca",70,4,2,

"in response to some discourse on here i want to make a statement: if you are an aetheist/werent raised religious/dont believe in god, that is not the same this as being a different religion in your relationship to christianity. being culturally christian and raised in an american society based around a christian belief system still affects not only how you see the world, but how the world sees you. your discomfort or disbelief in christianity is not equivalent to the experience of people raised outside of christianity and with other beliefs, and having been told or socialized in a place where those beliefs are seen as invalid. please be respectful of other cultures and people‚Äôs emotions during the holiday season. thank youüíôüíõ",12,4,,

Though I always get the impression that Smithies are more about status than neighboring colleges. I applied to one of their programs in the past, and asked for possible explanation to improve my application when I got rejected (not surprising because they only admit a handful of people). I got a reply from the head of the program that gave me no explanation, just ‚Äúdo not apply again‚Äù. It was harsh, but it fits the type of people I‚Äôve met who went to Smith.
