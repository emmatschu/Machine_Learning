5348,"hello, my previous post was taken down. However I am still dealing with the situation that occured in Jordan, and I need to find my way out of this house. To help people understand the urgency of this post, here is the situation: On Monday, I asked the jordan GroupMe to do better cleaning up after using the sinks, for every sink had food waste, toothpaste, and garbage in it when I went to brush my teeth.

He has sexually assaulted two of my friends and has used drugs to disable individuals to assault them. I am posting this on the confessional because he has tried to create bonds with Smith students and uses his dogs as a means to get women and femme people to interact with him. Because none of the assaults have happened to smith college students the college cannot ban him from the property even though he is a predator. I have seen him in the smith college gym and inside some buildings. Please be cautious. ",74

269,"‚ÄúSmith is the type of school with a very specific personality, and they look for students who fit in that description. The location is fairly downtown and walkable. Really nice facilities though nothing eye-catching. Dorm buildings are older but quaint. You‚Äôd have access to the five college consortium, which means you can take classes from any of them. Though I always get the impression that Smithies are more about status than neighboring colleges. I applied to one of their programs in the past, and asked for possible explanation to improve my application when I got rejected (not surprising because they only admit a handful of people). I got a reply from the head of the program that gave me no explanation, just ‚Äúdo not apply again‚Äù. It was harsh, but it fits the type of people I‚Äôve met who went to Smith.

People can post what they want on confesh and if they needed to vent about their family, let them vent about their family. It may be upsetting for you to hear about it, but imagine how op felt having to be surrounded by those people. If you can‚Äôt handle it, maybe confesh isn‚Äôt the place for you. Saying things like ‚Äúthanks for reminding me homophobia exists!‚Äù is dumb I‚Äôm sorry. Of course homophobia exists. We live in a world where people are killed for their sexual orientation. I will never be able to come out to my grandparents. Let people talk about some of the things in the word that suck becuase guess what?
